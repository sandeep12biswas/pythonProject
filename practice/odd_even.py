Exercise 2 (and Solution)
The exercise comes first (with a few extras if you want the extra challenge or want to spend more time), followed by a discussion. Enjoy!

Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.
Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?

Extras:

If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check).
If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.
"""

num = input("Please enter any number: ")

while not num.isnumeric():
    num = input("Input valid number: ")

num = int(num)

if num % 2 == 0:
    print(f"{num} is an even number")
else:
    print(f"{num} is an odd number")
